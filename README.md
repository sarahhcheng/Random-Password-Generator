# Random-Password-Generator
Generates a random password based on the length and character types a user inputs.

## How it works
There will be a prompt that asks the user to input their desired password length. The user then has the choice of having the password include digits, characters, and special characters. The generator will then spit out a password that satisfy those conditions
